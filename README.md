![Kotlin logo](/_logos/kotlin.png?raw=true "Kotlin logo")
![React logo](/_logos/react.png?raw=true "React logo")

Just another todo web app example. :)

Built with [create-react-kotlin-app](https://github.com/JetBrains/create-react-kotlin-app)@1.06.

## installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/cnguy/kotlin-react-todos.git
cd kotlin-react-todos
yarn && yarn start
```

## surge.sh deployment

```sh
yarn build
cd build
surge # do w/e CLI says
```

Go to the URL that you entered (e.g. [https://kotlin-todos.surge.sh](https://kotlin-todos.surge.sh)).

## app notes 

All the todo app code is pretty much in [./src/todolist](https://github.com/cnguy/kotlin-react-todos/tree/master/src/todolist).
Currently, this is missing the MVC part of `todomvc` + the code quality is bad, and so it's not gonna be submitted to [todomvc](http://todomvc.com). I may submit it in the future though (I'd have to properly port everything) if nothing else pops up, and if the API is stable (I am unsure of this). This app was mostly for quickly experimenting with Kotlin / React.

So there are some big removals as this is an (simpler) unofficial implementation..

* No persistence (no local storage). I have a lot of this code set up locally though.
* Instead of '0 items left', the text is 'All items completed'.
* A router isn't used. The todo app component itself manages the filter state (ALL/ACTIVE/COMPLETED).
* CSS transitions removed (see issue).

## development notes 

Developing with `create-react-kotlin-app` feels just like developing with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

No new build tools were imposed on me; I was free to just throw a bunch of Kotlin at my screen and run the `npm`/`yarn` commands that I always run.

For directory structure / code style, I simply tried to follow the boilerplate files generated by `create-react-kotlin-app`.

Useful Commands:
```sh
yarn # install
yarn start
yarn build # build for production
# If you are unable to start the app after building,
# clear the node_modules cache:
# rm -rf ./node_modules/.cache
```

## contributing 

Feel free to clean up some of my code if it bothers you -- I'm very new to Kotlin! I'm open to all advice. :)
